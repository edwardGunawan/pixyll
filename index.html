{% comment %}
  site.post is the retrieve the reverse chronological of all the post (nothing to do with _config.yml file)
  Passing the variable inside include posts.html (and posts.html get the posts variable from include.posts)
  example : {% include posts.html posts = site.posts %}

  Since there is pagination the above will just show the value
{% endcomment %}

{% include posts.html %}
